### Motivation

I made this for working in background in my Raspberry Pi to check the status of my internet connection automatically.

### How it works

When you start the app, it program a crontab for launch a Internet Speed Test and store the result on a [embeded db based on MongoDB](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb).

Also starts a web server with ExpressJS who loads the data from the db and shows to you in a web page.

### How Install and use

**You need Node.js ([for Windows, Mac or Linux](https://nodejs.org/en/), for [Raspberry Pi](http://weworkweplay.com/play/raspberry-pi-nodejs/)) for running this.**

Download the [last release](https://github.com/SantiMA10/Internet-Status-Check/releases), unzip it, download all the dependencies with **npm install** and lunch it in foreground with **node app.js** or lunch it in background with **node app.js &**.

##### Start on startup on the Raspberry Pi

In your Raspberry Pi, edit the **rc.local** with **sudo nano /etc/rc.local** or your favourite editor:
```
# Print the IP address
_IP=$(hostname -I) || true
if [ "$_IP" ]; then
  printf "My IP address is %s\n" "$_IP"
fi

node /home/pi/Internet-Status-Check/app.js > /dev/null & //Add this line with the correct route to the app

exit 0
```

### Configuration

Edit the file **config.json**...

```
{
  "crontab" : "0 0 */3 * * *", // A crontab pattern, for example: this execute the test every 3 hours
  "port" : 8080               // Port for the web page
}
```

...or visit the **configuration page**:
