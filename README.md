# Internet-Status-Checker

### How it works

When you start the app, it program a crontab for launch a Internet Speed Test and store the result on a [embeded db based on MongoDB](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb).

Also starts a web server with ExpressJS who loads the data from the db and shows to you in a web page.

### How Install and use

**You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for running this.**

Download the [last release](https://github.com/SantiMA10/Internet-Status-Check/releases), unzip it, download all the dependencies with **npm install** and lunch it with **node app.js**.

### Configuration

Edit the file **config.json**

```
{
  "crontab" : "* * */6 * * *", // A crontab pattern 
  "port" : 8080               // Port for the web page
}
```
